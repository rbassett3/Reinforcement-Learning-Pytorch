Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Pytorch and OpenAI's Gym.

## 1. Lunar Lander with Deep Q-Learning and Experience Replay

This project implements the [LunarLander-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) from OpenAI's Gym with Pytorch. The goal is to land the lander safely in the landing pad with the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

### Introduction

Landing pad is always at coordinates `(0,0)`. Coordinates are the first two numbers in state vector. Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about `100..140` points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional `-100` or `+100` points. Each leg ground contact is `+10`. Firing main engine is `-0.3` points each frame. Solved is `200` points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.
